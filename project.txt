1. Enter the spreadsheet and extract the client's CPF.
2. Access the CPF consultation website and use the CPF from the spreadsheet to search for the client's payment status.
3. Check if it is up to date or overdue.
4. If it is "up to date," get the payment date and payment method.
5. Otherwise (if overdue), set the status as pending.
6. Insert this new information (name, amount, CPF, due date, status, and if up to date, payment date, payment method (credit card or boleto)) into a new spreadsheet.
7. Repeat until reaching the last client.
